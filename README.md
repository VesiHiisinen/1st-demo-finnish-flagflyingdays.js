# 1st-demo-finnish-flagflyingdays.js
This script prints out finnish flag flying days for the calendar year. This mainly for my own github practice. Feel free to contribute!

This is the first version of the script. There is still much to correct. The script is not general enough to be implemented easily. Some changes are required. Also, some of the methodes used are clumsy. Check the issues for more info!
